This is a vanilla JavaScript project from the bootcamp, or more like, several vanilla JS projects merged into one.  
There is a todo list, an address book, geolocation with Google Map (which makes the app lag, sorry), and the possibility to change the app's colors.  

I've finished it after the bootcamp but kept the original feel.
