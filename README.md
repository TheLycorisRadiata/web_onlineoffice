This is a vanilla JavaScript project from the bootcamp, or more like, several vanilla JS projects merged into one.  
There is a todo list, an address book, geolocation, and the possibility to change the app's colors.  

I've finished it after the bootcamp but kept the original feel. Also, after the bootcamp, I've dabbled into Google Maps a little bit to add it to the geolocation module, and I've forgotten about the idea since it costs money **not** to have it make the app lag.
